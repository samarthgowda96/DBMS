This is Database created for a Research paper Review Entity diagram and are populated with some  examples and also, all my SQl Commands such as Create, insert and select are all included in my Paper.sql file and all the statements are executed in this file. This was achieved by Using IF EXISTS and IF NOT EXISTS Statements.
